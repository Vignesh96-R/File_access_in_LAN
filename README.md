A modern web-based file explorer built using **Flask**. It allows browsing, previewing, uploading, and deleting files directly through your browser with a user-friendly interface.

✅ You can also access this file explorer from **any device on your local network (LAN)** — simply use the system's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8000`) in a browser on another device connected to the same Wi-Fi or LAN.
