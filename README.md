# File Access in LAN

This project is being refactored into a modular Flask application with the following structure:

```
File_access_in_LAN/
  app/
    __init__.py
    routes.py
    utils.py
    file_ops.py
    config.py
    templates/
  tests/
  run.py
  README.md
  requirements.txt
```

- Run the app with `python run.py`.
- All Flask logic is now modularized in the `app/` package.
